:::{admonition} Highlights
:class: important
-  Most users do not set the Target Glucose setting lower than 5-6 mmol/L (90-110 mg/dL), to reduce the chance of iAPS or the user overcorrecting and causing a low.
:::
The Target Glucose setting allows you to set a number for the system to aim for, in setting temporary basals and when calculating bolus doses.

Consult with your healthcare profesional on an appropriate target for your blood sugar.
